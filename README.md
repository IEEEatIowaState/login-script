## IEEE Login Script

This script is used for keeping attendance at ISU chapter IEEE meetings. 
It was written using the JS [Google Sheets API V4](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/) and [Google Drive API V3](https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/reference/). 

In order to run this you will need access to a Drive account which has permission to edit 
[the attendance files](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B2RZchU2dvreZXd0SkpOOC16Slk).

The site is hosted [here](https://ieee-login-script-v2.firebaseapp.com/) and all site credentials are currently administrated by Ethan Williams, Secretary.
