## IEEE Login Script

This script is used for keeping attendance at ISU chapter IEEE meetings. 
It was written using NodeJS and uses [Google Sheets API V4](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/) and [Google Drive API V3](https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/reference/). 

In order to run this you will need access to a Google account which has permission to edit 
[the attendance files](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B2RZchU2dvreZXd0SkpOOC16Slk) and will need to copy the OAuth2.0 Client ID JSON file to the directory from [here](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=silken-apex-192523).
