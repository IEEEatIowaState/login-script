## IEEE Login Script

This script is used for keeping attendance at ISU chapter IEEE meetings. 
The script was written using Node and uses Google Sheets API V4 and Google Drive API V3. 
In order to run this you will need access to a Google account which has permission to edit 
the files (IEEE->OfficerStuff->Secretary) and will need to copy the OAuth2.0 client ID json file to the directory.
